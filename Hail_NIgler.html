            <span><i><b>NITROGLYCERIN IS USED AS A MEDICINE FOR HEART DISEASES ALSO AS A EXPLOSIVE LIKE
                        DYNAMITE</b></i></span><br><br>
            Steps to produce Nitroglycerin<br><br>

            1. Fill a 75-milliliter beaker, to the 13-ml. level, with fuming red nitric acid, of 98 percent
            concentration.
            <br><br>

            2. Place beaker in an ice bath and allow to cool below room temperature. <br><br>

            3. After it is cooled, add to it three times the amount of fuming sulfuric acid (99 percent). In other
            words,
            add to the now-cool fuming nitric acid 39 milliliters of fuming sulfuric acid. When mixing any acids, always
            do
            it slowing and carefully to avoid splattering. <br><br>

            4. When the two are mixed, lower their temperature, by adding more ice to the bath, to about 10 or 15
            degrees
            Centegrade. This can be measured by using a mercury-operated Centegrade thermometer. <br><br>

            5. When the acid solution has cooled to the desired temperature, it is ready for the glycerin. The glyverin
            MUST
            BE ADDED IN SMALL AMOUNTS USING A MEDICINE DROPPER. Glycerin is added, slowly and carefully, until the
            entire
            surface of the acid is covered with it. <br><br>

            6. This is a dangerous point, since the nitration will take place as soon as the glycerin is added. The
            nitration will produce heat, so the solution MUST BE KEPT BELOW 30 DEGREES C. If the solution should go
            above 30
            degrees, the beaker should be taken out of the ice bath and the solution should be carefully poured directly
            into the ice bath, since this will prevent an explosion. <br><br>

            7. For about the first ten minutes of the nitration, the mixture should be gently stirred. In a normal
            reaction,
            the nitroglycerin will form as a layer ontop of the acid solution, while the sulfuric acid will absorb the
            excess water. <br><br>

            8. After the nitration has taken place and the nitroglycerin has formed at the top of the acid solution, the
            entire beaker should be transferred very slowly and carefully to another beaker of water. When this is done,
            the
            nitroglycerin will settle to the bottom, so that most of the acid solution can be drained away. <br><br>

            9. After removing as much acid as possible without disturbing the nitro- glycerin, remove the nitroglycerin
            with
            an eyedropper and place it in a bicarbonate of soda (sodium bicarbonate) solution. The sodium bicarbonate is
            an
            alkali and will neutralize much of the acid remaining. This process should be repeated as many times as
            necessary using blue litmus paper to check for the presence of acid. The remaining acid only make the
            nitroglycerin more unstable than is normally is. <br><br>

            10. The final step is to remove the nitroglycerin from the bicarbonate. This is done with an eyedropper,
            slowly
            and carefully. The usual test to see if nitration has been successful is to place one drop of the
            nitroglycerin
            on a metal plate and ignite it. If it is true nitro- glycerin, it will burn with a clear bule flame.
            <br><br>

            <i>CAUTION: Nitroglycerin is EXTREMELY sensitive to decomposition, heating, dropping, or jarring, and may
                explode even if
                left undisturbed and cool. KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING BEFORE YOU DO IT!!!!!</i>
